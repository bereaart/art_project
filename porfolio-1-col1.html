                    The Bird of America, 1971-72, was the first completed reprint edition of Audubon’s book. It was published in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, using the original copy sold by Audubon to the Teyler Museum in the early 1800’s. This project was supervised by an international panel of notable ornithologists and Audubon experts. Birds of America consisted of 435 actual sized watercolour drawings of birds from America and a scenery to help display the bird in its natural environment. The steps Audubon took to draw a bird started off by hunting them down and turning them into taxidermy. Audubon wanted to make sure he captured all of the right colors, shapes, and details in every part of the art. Audubon sold the engraved plates in England, Europe, and North America. People who bought them received five plates at a time including one large bird, one medium bird, three small birds over a period between 1827 and 1838.

                    One of the most notable works created by José De Acosta would be The Natural and Moral History of the Indies. This work was published in 1590 by José De Acosta and served to recount his findings as the new world was being investigated. Acosta’s work served many purposes such as convincing the European people that there was in fact a whole new continent and people did indeed live there. The book also provided one of, if not the first detailed descriptions of things such as the uses of coco, the geography of Latin America, and Aztec history. Acosta went far beyond simply giving descriptions and observations as to what was going on in the new world. He sought to give cause as to why the things that were happening actually happened and how they might have come about. José De Acosta acknowledged that he was one of the first authors to try and give cause and reason to things that were happening in the world. Although Acosta died in 1600, his works helped shape the world’s understanding of this new continent that had been discovered and what might be lurking on it. This work belongs in our exhibit because it gives us insight into our continent before it was investigated while at the same time giving us reasoning and descriptions of the events that transpired at the time.
