                    <i>The Birds and Trees of North America</i>
                    displays Brasher’s desire to convey birds
                    in their natural habitat. Rex Brasher
                    had a dream since the age of eight to discover and
                    display birds in North America. Brasher achieved his
                     goal by recording more than twice the amount of birds
                     in North America than his predecessor James Audubon.
                      Brasher had a vengeance towards Audubon because he
                       would not meet with his dad when he took a journey
                       just to see him. Once Brasher heard this story,
                       he made it his life’s mission to record more birds
                        than Audubon. During his journey throughout
                         North America, Brasher recorded several
                         species of birds that are now extinct such as
                         the Heath Hen, Passenger Pigeon and Eskimo Curlew.
                         These birds may have never been discovered if not for Brasher.
                         After his journey, Brasher decided to have his drawings printed
                         in black and white for cost efficiency. He received these prints
                         and established a new technique by combining airbrushing and the
                         use of stencils to color the prints. In this print of the flamingos,
                          Brasher focused on the perfection of these birds such as making them
                          as lifelike as possible and portraying the flamingos in their natural
                          habitat. There is also rich color in this print with the
                          bold pinks which came from the airbrush and stencil technique
                          that Brasher developed for these prints.

Captured in Audubon’s publication of <i>Birds of America</i>, <i>the Prothonotary Warbler</i>
 is presented with explicit detail and accuracy. The <i>Prothonotary Warbler</i>
  represents only one of the five colored prints produced by William Home Lizars.
  Lizars selected five drawings to demonstrate the different treatments of small
  and large birds in the printing process. Shortly after Lizars produced these five colored prints,
  members of his studio involved in the coloring process of the prints went on strike.
  As a result, Audubon turned to the Havell family to produce the colored
  prints for his book. Audubon presents two prothonotary warblers, each in a different position.
  The placement of the two warblers provides information of how the species look from different
  angles, providing visual clues of any marks, textures and forms that contribute to identification.
  The <i>Prothonotary Warbler</i>
   may be found in the floodplain forests and swampy regions from southern
   New Jersey to north-central Florida and may be found in the mainland extending to Texas.
    As depicted by Audubon, the prothonotary warbler
    displays high contrast between the lower and upper halves of the body.
    The distinct color palette of a yellow body in contrast with its blue to gray wings
    and olive colored back can lead to identification of this species of warbler alone.
    In comparison to the other birds that Audubon captures in his published works,
    the warbler is small in size. In celebration of Audubon who has contributed to
     the field of ornithology through his extensive documentation of birds, the <i>Prothonotary Warbler</i>
      presents a reminder of extensive dedication and research that Audubon conducted during his lifetime.

Theodore Jasper displays the real life aspects and scenery surrounding the American Barn Owls,
 Lanier Falcon, and the Pygmy Burrowing Hawk in this print. Jasper spent his
  lifetime studying ornithology; the scientific study of birds.
  Jasper’s prints were similar because of his tendency to group different birds
   with no correlation together in one print. That is displayed in this print with the Owls,
   Falcon, and Hawk. All of Jasper’s prints were reduced to one quarter of their natural size,
   which affected the cost of the book. The important aspect of this print and all of the prints
    in this book was the affordability. Struders Popular Ornithology: the <i>Birds of North America</i>
     was the first bird identification book that was affordable for common
     people, unlike prints that came before such as James Audubon’s book of <i>North American birds</i>.
      Although not the best quality of prints, Struders Popular Ornithology: <i>the Birds of North America</i>
       was one of the most desired bird books of the nineteenth century based on its affordability.

<i>The Night Heron</i> is a print from one of Audubon’s most respected works: <i>The Birds of America</i>.
 Audubon provides basic facts about the specimen in his field guide accompaniment. <i>The Night Heron</i>
  is a southern bird known by many unofficial names in different states.
   A list of these names includes: “The Indian Pullet,” the “Gros-bec,” the “Indian Hen” and
    the “Qua-bird.” These birds migrate at night making
     “loud hoarse notes that resemble the syllable Qua.” The Night Heron is important for
      understanding the overall work of Audubon because it is an example of a plate from his
       most famous undertaking. This piece in particular also gave the ornithological community
       new information about the Night Heron through the field guide.
       He found that three molting periods are required for the plumage of the <i>Night Heron</i>
        to fully mature. The immature birds were being misclassified as different subspecies
        when they were actually the very same bird. There are many other cases from the field
         guide as well, where Audubon was a contributor to discovering the anatomy and behavior of
         the bird under observation. In fact, he is credited with discovering 25 new species and 12
         subspecies during his travels. He was even elected as a member of the Royal Society of London
         for his ideas in scientific work.

                    Since the name of Audubon is so universally associated with birds,
                    his paintings of terrestrial mammals of North America might be a
                    surprise for many people. After the publication of <i>The Birds of America</i>
                     that earned John James Audubon worldwide fame, the
                     last ten years of Audubon’s life were spent on documenting four-legged mammals.
                     Even though the proposed project was very difficult to accomplish, Audubon
                     thought he would collect, identify, paint the portraits, and write
                     the description of each of them. With such an enthusiasm, he immediately
                     announced the future publication of <i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America</i>.
                      Soon, he received a letter from his friend John Bachman
                       who offered his help saying “…are you not too fast in issuing your prospectus…? …
                       The animals have never been carefully described, and you will find difficulties at every
                        step. Books cannot aid you much. I have studied the subject more than you have… Say
                        in what manner I can assist you.”

                    As a result, John Bachman did a significant
                    contribution in producing the Quadrupeds by determining the validity of species,
                    writing all scientific descriptions, and contributing his personal observation on
                    habits of the animal. On the other hand, Audubon with the help of his son
                    John Woodhouse Audubon, painted and produced 150 drawings that were
                    included in <i>The Quadrupeds of North America</i>. Audubon used several artists to
                    reprint his paintings. For example, a skilled lithographer,
                    J.T. Bowen who was from Philadelphia had a contract with Audubon to
                    lithograph and color his paintings. Printing, on the other hand was done by
                    other Philadelphian craftsmen.
