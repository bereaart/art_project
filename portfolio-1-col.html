                Bringing together materials from the
                College Art Collection and Special Collections and Archives,
                 this exhibition explores the work of John James Audubon within the
                 larger context of the history of natural history. Beginning with one of
                  the first accounts of the fauna of the Americas and ending with a print
                  made on Berea College’s campus, this exhibition situates Audubon’s monumental
                   work into a larger conversation about the natural history of North America.
                    This exhibition was curated by the students in
                    Meghan Doherty’s ARH 215: History of Printmaking in the West class with the
                     support of Rachel Vagts and Sharyn Mitchell.

The dedication to the study of birds during the 1800’s captures
 the work of John James Audubon and John Gould. These two men sought to
 produce images of birds as they appeared, displaying information of a wide
 range of species that would forever document birds in clarity.
  Understanding these birds could be achieved through physical and artistic
  representation in their publications. Gould’s best known publications including <i>Birds of Australia</i>,
  <i> Birds of Asia</i>and <i>A Monograph of the Trochilidae (Family of Hummingbirds)</i>.
   <i>The Erythronota Edwardi Hummingbird</i> can  be found in the fifth volume of <i>A Monograph
       of the Trochilidae</i>. This specific species of hummingbird has a white abdomen,
       a rich green colored head and neck that bleeds into a purple hue that spreads from the
       shoulders to the tail and the grassy green color that covers the breast. The name of the
       bird is derived from the man who gave noticeable attention to natural history, Edward Wilson.
        Gould’s experiences were turned into artistic reproductions that would gain him recognition
         and subscription from the royal families of Europe and natural historians.
          The birds documented from his travels such as those done with Charles
           Darwin through Tasmania, the islands of Bass’s Strait, South Australia and
           New South Wales are considered to be scientific achievements because of the
           extensive documentation of the birds from these regions.

                    John James Audubon’s <i>White American Wolf</i>,
                    compliments his style for drawing wildlife creatures
                    by making the figures stand out against  the background
                    in all of his prints. Audubon does a great job showing expression
                    in the wolf by adding depth to its muscles and fur and even its fangs.
                    The American white wolf, shown in the middle of a feast reveals its teeth to
                    the viewer, creates an emotion to the viewer in what looks
                    like to be an invasion of privacy by the viewer as well as the artist.
                     Just like Audubon’s birds, his other wildlife creatures are always presented in natural attitudes. His prints depict animals living their everyday lives.Audubon did two different forms for his drawings one for small species and one for bigger species.  Audubon would also work from dead specimens and each of his drawings would be a composition consciously designed to display the living animal to best advantage.Audubon and acquaintances of his hunted these kinds of Wolves and knowing Audubon’s technique of drawing composition consciously would draw this Wolf alive and in a position that is considered normal to its environment which would leave the print looking very realistic.

            The grey squirrel is one of the most abundant types of squirrel that can be found in
            Central Kentucky. The same holds true more specifically in the Berea area of Kentucky. Dan Short, the creator of this piece did this because he wished to give something back to Berea after graduating from the College. He decided to create a painting with the intent of it being marketed so that the proceeds would come back to the College. The Berea College Grey Squirrel was initially started in 1977 and completed in 1979. Dan Short wished for people to understand how the animals actually looked out in the wild and how the squirrels interacted with the bird life.  Short himself credits many different influences that guided his work but also believed that his style was something that he has made his own. Many will agree that Short managed to capture the authenticity of the details that make up the animals depicted in the print. This piece was added to the exhibit due to its relevance to Berea College culture. The grey squirrels make up a large part of the Berea College wildlife and Dan Short wished to give something back to the college that he felt represented it.

                    <i>The Bird of America</i>, 1971-72, was the
                    first completed reprint edition of Audubon’s book.
                     It was published in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,
                     using the original copy sold by Audubon to the Teyler Museum
                     in the early 1800’s. This project was supervised by an international
                     panel of notable ornithologists and Audubon experts. <i>Birds of America</i>
                      consisted of 435 actual sized watercolour drawings of birds from America
                      and a scenery to help display the bird in its natural environment.
                      The steps Audubon took to draw a bird started off by hunting
                      them down and turning them into taxidermy.
                      Audubon wanted to make sure he captured all of the right colors,
                       shapes, and details in every part of the art.
                       Audubon sold the engraved plates in England, Europe, and North America.
                        People who bought them received five plates at a time including one
                        large bird, one medium bird, three small birds over a period between 1827 and 1838.

                    John James Audubon’s <i>Mockingbird</i>, painted in 1827,
                    demonstrates Audubon’s love of nature and his ability to evoke the
                    splendors of different American landscapes. He starts with the paradisiacal
                    description of Louisiana habitat of the mockingbird being the bounties of nature
                    with scandent growth of vines and thousand beautiful flowers . In such a beautiful
                    scene, he then places the mockingbird to be a delight to the nature of Louisiana
                    flying around his mate with motions as light comparing it to the butterfly.
                     In the painting, with the scene of the rattlesnake attacking the
                     mockingbird’s nest, Audubon expresses his astonishment to the courage
                     the mockingbird takes to confront the rattlesnake as he
                     describes the mockingbirds being always ready not only to defend
                     themselves with courage but to meet the aggressor and force him to
                     abandon his intention. Finally, with such a beautiful description of the
                      mystical landscape of Louisiana, Audubon assumes that such fertility of
                      nature should serve human needs instead of being neglected. This plate
                       of Audubon’s Mockingbird was later reprinted in Amsterdam in 1971.
