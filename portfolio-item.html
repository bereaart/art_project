            <p class="labels">
                John James Audubon’s significant work as a naturalist is unique in style that
                distinguishes him from other naturalists when it comes to an overall era of the
                Natural History.
                 His extensive study and documentation of birds and depicting them through life-sized watercolor paintings captures one’s attention and raises one’s awareness about nature and its creatures. It is very important to show off his work through a website in order to reach a larger
                audience and raise awareness in them about nature, birds and the Natural History.
                When it comes to a context of the Natural History and ornithology, Audubon was
                not the first person to document and paint all species of
                birds of America. Certainly, there were many other naturalists before and after him.
                However, John James Audubon has been a significant figure in the field of ornithology
                whose work surpasses other naturalists’ work for several reasons. One of the reasons is that
                Audubon’s prints were life-sized watercolors that made his work very special and original.
                Audubon insisted on drawing birds and then printing each of the birds at actual size.

                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    John James Audubon, born April 26, 1785 in Les Cayes,
                    in what is now Haiti, was an American naturalist and a painter,
                     known for his extensive studies and documenting all types of American birds.
                     At the age of eighteen, the son of a French sea captain, John James Audubon
                     came to United States because of the war that broke out between France and England.
                      He lived in Mill Grove, Pennsylvania where also conducted his first scientific studies. In 1808, Audubon married to Lucy Bakewell whom he met and fell in love the year after his arrival in America.
Fascinated with the beauty of nature, Audubon decided to focus his fascination upon the birds of America.
 He traveled throughout the country in order to draw and study birds in their natural habitats by carefully
  observing their behavior. His most well-known work is a color-plate book named <i>The Birds of America</i> that
  contains illustrations of a various species of American birds. In order to print <i>The Birds of America</i>,
  Audubon had to sail from New Orleans to Liverpool with his portfolio of more than 300 drawings. As a
  result, in 1826, he raised enough money to publish his <i>Birds of America</i> which consists of 435 hand-colored,
 life-size prints of 497 bird species which were made from engraved copper plates of different sizes.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audubon decided to focus his fascination upon the birds of America. He traveled throughout the country in order to draw and study birds in their natural habitats by carefully observing their behavior. His most well-known work is a color-plate book named The Birds of America that contains illustrations of a various species of American birds. In order to print The Birds of America, Audubon had to sail from New Orleans to Liverpool with his portfolio of more than 300 drawings. As a result, in 1826, he raised enough money to publish his Birds of America which consists of 435 hand-colored, life-size prints of 497 bird species which were made from engraved copper plates of different sizes.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the publication of <i>The Birds of America</i> that earned John James Audubon worldwide fame,
    the last ten years of Audubon’s life were spent on documenting four-legged mammals. Even though
    the proposed project was very difficult to accomplish, Audubon thought he would collect, identify,
    paint the portraits, and write the description of each of them. With such an enthusiasm, he immediately
    announced the future publication of <i>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America</i>.
    With the help of his friend John Bachman, Audubon was able to publish his book of <i>Quadrupeds of North
    America.</i> John Bachman,
    on the other hand, did a significant contribution in producing the <i>Quadrupeds</i> by determining
    the validity of species, writing all scientific descriptions, and contributing his personal
    observation on habits of the animal. On the other hand, Audubon with the help of his son
    John Woodhouse Audubon, painted and produced 150 drawings that were included in
    <i>The Quadrupeds of North America</i>. Audubon used several artists to reprint his paintings.
    For example, a skilled lithographer, J.T. Bowen who was from Philadelphia had a contract with
    Audubon to lithograph and color his paintings. Printing, was done by other Philadelphian craftsmen.

                <h3><i>Why is Audubon important?</i></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John James Audubon, also known as Jean-Jacques Audobon, was one of the major contributors of masterpieces to American art. With an avid interest in birds and drawing right from his childhood days, Audubon went on to be the most distinguished illustrator of the 19th century. Venturing into nature and observing,
                    he explored different American birds and documented them.
                    Audubon’s work is a significant
                    contribution to the history of natural history. His books such as <i>The Birds of America</i> raise
                    one’s awareness about one’s natural world and its natural creatures. That is why, it is very
                     important to show off Audubon’s significant work and contributions to our society through art
                     exhibitions. Since a lot of people, nowadays, use social media on a daily basis, it would
                      be even more convenient to familiarize people with the work
                    of Audubon through websites that are dedicated to John James Audubon.
