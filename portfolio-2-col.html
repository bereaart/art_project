                    This print depicts a family of racoons nested on a tree.
                    Ray Harm sketches his work before he prints them and he does so up close,
                    and in the wild instead of just sketching from imagination or copy.
                     This print and its orientation is very similar to the birds that
                     Harm primarily works with in most of his pieces. Each raccoon is on
                      a different side of the tree, and this orientation makes the viewer
                      move their eyes across the paper to observe each raccoon.
                       This print creates a very soft and calm feeling, for instance,
                         the raccoons are a family living together, and exactly what
                          Harm tries to capture in his prints, the nature and wildlife
                           up close and personal and without leaving out any realism.
                           This Ray Harm’s print, shows the subject interacting with one
                           another, in fact, a lot of his works are very flat and
                           shows the subjects only appearing individually on the paper as if they are not in the same place at the same time, and are only painted in spots that would seem ideally natural. The raccoons look aware of each other’s presence and this is the way Harm likes his paintings. This print would stand out to a viewer who might be interested in wildlife.

                In order to truly appreciate the production and quality of
                Audubon’s <i>The Birds of America</i>, one must first
                reference the other possible outcomes. In the case of Audubon,
                he initially found himself struggling to find a printer who would produce <i>Birds</i>.
                Eventually, Audubon struck up a business agreement with famous
                British engraver William Home Lizars. Lizars had ample amounts of
                experience undertaking projects similar to Audubon’s.
                When Lizars first became enamored by Audubon’s <i>Birds</i>,
                 he was in the midst of working on plates for P.J.
                 Shelby’s Illustrations of British Ornithology.
                  Lizars was familiar with the medium, but a printers’ strike and a series of
                  business choices by both Audubon and Lizars halted any efforts to produce prints
                  from this agreement. Years later, Lizars was responsible for printing
                  Robert Hamilton’s <i>Natural History of British Fishes</i>.
                   Hamilton provided a prolific amount of work on various marine life throughout his career.
                    Whereas Audubon passion soared to new heights,
                    Hamilton’s great contributions saw the ocean’s depths. <i>British Fishes</i>
                     is a field guide collection with
                     illustration prints accompanying all information about these marine life.
                     All of the fish are drawn with their natural color schemes intact, and due
                      to the limitations of size, the fish find themselves in much more natural
                      poses instead of the contortions that are prevalent in works similar to <i>Birds</i>.

            <i>Le Petit Caporal</i> is quite different from many of the prints
            Audubon drew for <i>The Birds of America</i>. <i>Le Petit Caporal</i>
             was a small hawk found by Audubon in 1812, and was named after Napoleon Bonaparte,
             as this namesake was a nickname for Napoleon. Thus, Audubon, having found the specimen
              during Napoleon’s greatest time of power used the nickname for the bird.
              There is only one bird pictured in this piece because Audubon found only
               one specimen of this bird during his travels, which he first encountered
                whilst it was on a fence post, as depicted in the print, in a regal and
                dignified pose, which is different from his standard positioning of the other
                 birds in Birds of America. It lacks a background, as Audubon was unsure of the
                  life style and characteristics of this hawk. Not finding a nest or any other
                  specimens of this bird, Audubon decided to pose the bird as he had seen while
                   it was alive. Audubon presumed the bird he found was a rare and new species
                    and gave the name that entitles this piece. In current ornithology terms,
                    this bird is  known by the common name of a Merlin (Falco columbarius).

                    Serving as a companion to his prolific work <i>The Birds of America</i>,
                    John James Audubon also covered a bulk of the mammals of the North American
                    continent in The Quadrupeds of North America. Audubon first rose to prominence
                    for his efforts in documenting as many North American avian creatures as possible.
                    Years later when collecting his works for <i>Quadrupeds</i>,
                     Audubon trekked across the American prairie one final time at fifty-eight years old.
                      Unlike the art found in <i>Birds</i>, <i>Quadrupeds</i> is not the life-sized endeavor that Birds
                      is famous for. This collection forgoes the sheer size of the animals
                       to focus on the wide variety of wildlife found in North America.
                       Much like Birds, Quadrupeds stages the subjects in a natural environment.
                        The framing of the Columbian pouched rats in question are no different.
                        The rodents are portrayed as a trio to offer multiple perspectives of the
                        animal in question. The aerial view allows for the audience to see the size
                        the rat’s pouches relative to the rest of its physique. Through this print we
                        learn that Columbian pouched rats reside in burrows as their natural habit, and viewers can also see that the rats populate areas close to bodies of water due to the lake in the background.  It is also displayed that the rats can survive in sparse lands as evident in the print’s lack of vegetation.

One of the most notable works created by José De Acosta would be <i>The Natural and Moral History of the Indies</i>.
 This work was published in 1590 by José De Acosta and served to recount his findings as the
 new world was being investigated. Acosta’s work served many purposes such as convincing the
 European people that there was in fact a whole new continent and people did indeed live there.
 The book also provided one of, if not the first detailed descriptions of things such as the uses of
 coco, the geography of Latin America, and Aztec history. Acosta went far beyond simply giving
  descriptions and observations as to what was going on in the new world. He sought to give cause as
  to why the things that were happening actually happened and how they might have come about.
  José De Acosta acknowledged that he was one of the first authors to try and give cause and reason
  to things that were happening in the world. Although Acosta died in 1600, his works helped shape
   the world’s understanding of this new continent that had been discovered and what might be lurking on
    it. This work belongs in our exhibit because it gives us insight into our continent before it was
     investigated while at the same time giving us reasoning and descriptions of the events that
     transpired at the time.
